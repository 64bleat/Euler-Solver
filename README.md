# EulerSolutions-Java
This is a console-based program designed to contain and access my solutions to Project Euler problems.

Spoilers!
-
Don't view the problem classes if you want to solve them. That's no fun! Besides, I'm sure there are better ways to solve these.

Use
-
* Add and build the project in Eclipse.
* Run within Eclipse, or build and run 'Start.bat'
* Enter the problem number you would like to see solved. If there is no class associated with the solution, the input number is considered invalid.

```
Which problem would you like to solve? 1
```

* Including the word "link" with the number will open its Project Euler page and its GitHub source code page in your browser.

```
Which problem would you like to solve? link 2
```

* If the correct answer has not been stored yet, the program will ask if its output is correct. Anything other than 'yes' is a no.

```
No answer recorded. Is this correct? yes
```

* Typing 'yes' will save the result and time to better track efficiency.

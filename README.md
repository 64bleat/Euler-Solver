# EulerSolutions-Java
This is a console-based program designed to contain and access my solutions to Project Euler problems.

Spoilers!
-
Don't open the problem classes if you want to solve them. That's no fun! Besides, there's probably better ways.

Use
-
* Enter the problem number you would like to see solved. If it has not been solved yet, input will be seen as invalid.
* Including the word "link" with the number will open its Project Euler page and its GitHub source code page in your browser.
* If the correct answer has not been stored yet, the program will ask if its output is correct.
* If the correct answer is calculated, the run time will be saved to track efficiency.
